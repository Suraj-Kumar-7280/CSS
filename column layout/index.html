            Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. 
            Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: 
            a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, 
            a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, 
            the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.
            A paragraph is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. 
            Though not required by the orthographic conventions of any language with a writing system, paragraphs 
            are a conventional means of organizing extended segments of prose.
